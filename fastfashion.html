					<p>How much did you spend on the clothes in your closet? Fast fashion has changed the way people buy and dispose of clothing because of its cheap price and easy availability. While buying new clothes you might not think about the environment but behind making each piece of clothing, we put our environment at huge risk. And here the biggest concern is the emerging billion-dollar Fast Fashion industry. Fast fashion is a strategy employed by the fashion industry in which the latest fashion trends and high-end designs showcased on runways are imitated, produced in large quantities at a reduced cost, and dispatched rapidly to retail stores. Fast fashion became more prevalent in the late 20th century as the cost of manufacturing clothes decreased. </p>
					<p>The global fashion industry is responsible for <b>8-10% of global emissions</b>, according to the United Nations and this percentage is likely to increase up to <b>50 % by 2030</b> at this pace. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has provided data indicating that the entire production process of a pair of jeans, from growing the cotton to delivering the final product to a store, requires 3,781 liters of water and produces approximately 33.4 kilograms of carbon equivalent emissions.</p>

  <li>Every year the fashion industry uses 93 billion cubic meters of water.</li>
  <li>Around 20 % of wastewater worldwide comes from fabric dyeing and treatment.</li>
  <li>Of the total fabric used, 87% is disposed in landfills.</li>

<p>The fashion industry's overconsumption of clothing is strongly supported by fossil fuel-based fibers, which have become a crucial component of the industry's business model. These fibers also reinforce the fashion industry's reliance on continuous fossil fuel extraction, which is concerning given the current climate emergency. In 2015, global textile production totaled <b>1,715 million tonnes of CO2e3.</b> If non-biodegradable fabrics are used, the waste from discarded clothes (pre and post-consumer) can sit in landfills for 200 years.</p>

<p class="heading">E-commerce has grown exponentially, especially after 2020. According to data by Shopify, the year 2020 witnessed a significant surge in e-commerce sales worldwide, amounting to $4.2 trillion.This trend continued in 2021, leading to an estimated 2.14 billion online shoppers globally and generating $4.9 trillion in revenue. As per the predictions, the e-commerce industry is expected to grow further, and it is projected to exceed $7 trillion by 2025.<p>

	<div style="padding: 20px; background-color: lavender; font-size: 14px; color: black;">
	    <p>In 2020, fast fashion brand SHEIN announced sales of over 10 billion dollars and 15.7 billion in 2021. In June 2021, the company had nearly as many fast fashion sales in the US as H&M and Zara combined. Fast fashion industry has increased consumption over the years. Globally, 80 billion pieces of new clothing are purchased every year. That amounts to every single individual on the planet buying roughly 10 pieces of new clothing a year. </p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #666;">THE ENVIRONMENTAL COST OF FAST FASHION</h2>
<p>With the rise of globalization and growth of a global economy, supply chains have become international, shifting the growth of fibers, the manufacturing of textiles, and the construction of garments to areas with cheaper labor. Increased consumption drives the production of inexpensive clothing, and prices are kept down by outsourcing production to low and middle-income countries (LMICs) labour. <br>Supply chain waste occurs in the country where the fibres or fabrics are processed, and the amount varies by fabric and fibre type. The majority of garments sold in the UK are made in Asia.  The majority of supply chain waste, roughly 440,000 tonnes, is produced during the preparation of fibres to make yarn and during garment production, particularly in China and India.</p>

<div style="padding: 20px; background-color: lavender; font-size: 14px; color: black;">
	<p>The initial step in the global textile supply chain is textile production, which involves the creation of both natural and synthetic fibres. Approximately 90% of clothing sold in the United States is made of cotton or polyester, both of which have been linked to significant health risks associated with the manufacturing and production processes. In total, approximately 1900 chemicals can be found in textile production processes. <br>Under BAU Business as Usual, with 3% growth per annum in UK textiles consumption (by weight), the carbon footprint of textiles would increase from around 33 million tonnes CO2e in 2018, to over 40 million tonnes CO2e in 2030. The water footprint would increase from over 9 billion m3 water per annum to over 12 billion m3 . <p>
	</div>

<div class="chart" id="chart1"></div>

<p>In 2016 alone, <b>7.6 billion m3</b> of water was consumed during the production of raw materials to make clothing, and <b>5.25 billion m3</b> of this was consumed in the production of cotton for the UK. Cotton production accounts for <u>69% of the water footprint of textiles</u> fiber production and 65% of the total water footprint. <br> Polyester is a synthetic textile made from oil, whereas cotton requires a lot of water and pesticides to grow. 60% of polyester fabric is assumed to be produced in China, with the remaining 40% from India. Textile dyeing poses additional risks because untreated wastewater from dyes is frequently discharged into local water systems, releasing heavy metals and other toxicants that can harm the health of animals as well as nearby residents.
</p>
<p>Among the 55 global brands the Top ten brands that use the most synthetic fibers as a proportion of total fiber used as per research conducted by the Changing Markets Foundation in 2021 were: </p>

	<ul class="interactive-bullets">
	<li>The total carbon footprint of clothing in the UK is growing - rising from 24 million tonnes to 26.2 million tonnes per year in 2016, according to WRAP. If fashion continues on its current path, it could use more than 26% of the global carbon budget associated with a 2°C pathway by 2050, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.</li>
	<li>According to research, small plastic fragments pollute marine habitats around the world, potentially harming marine life. Synthetic clothing accounts for up to 35% of all primary source microplastics in the marine environment.</li>

<p>In the past two decades, fast fashion business models in the name of big fast fashion brands have grown significantly because of the increase in demand due to their inexpensive nature. And with this, the environmental and human health consequences of fast fashion have also increased. Climate change has already been affected to a greater extent. This is the time when we need to address the environmental risks associated with fast fashion. </p>
